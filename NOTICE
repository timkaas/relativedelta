Modifications to chrono's weekday.rs:
    1. Removed Rust module documentation header and replaced with simpler file-level documentation
    2. Removed rkyv archive and validation related code and features
    3. Modified serde implementation:
    - Removed separate weekday_serde module
    - Added direct serde attribute derive for the Weekday enum
    - Added serde rename and alias attributes for enum variants
    4. Changed From<u32> implementation to From<u8> with modulo operation for safety
    5. Simplified error handling in some implementations
    6. Removed parsing-related code (FromStr trait implementation)
    7. Modified test suite:
    - Removed rkyv-specific tests
    - Modified serde tests to match new implementation
    - Retained core functionality tests
    8. Removed documentation examples that referenced removed functionality
    9. Simplified some method implementations for better maintainability

The core weekday functionality and API remain largely unchanged from the original chrono implementation.
